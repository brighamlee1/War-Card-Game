# War-Project-1

- War is a card game where a deck of 52 cards is split between two people
- Both players will play a card and whichever is the highest rank wins
- If both players play the same ranked card, a war begins
- A war is where both players will place three cardsw face down and then flip one more card face up and whichever rank is higher wins.
- If their ranks were to be the same again, another war would begin.
- The game ends when one player is completely out of cards.
