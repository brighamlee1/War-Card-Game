## Future Implementations
- The next steps I would like to add to my game would be to implement adding animations to make the game more enjoyable and aesthetic.
- I would like to make it look like the cards are actually being flipped over.
- Adding these features would allow the game to look much more fluent and appear as a real game that could be put online.
