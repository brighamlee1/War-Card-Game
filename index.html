            Each player will be dealt 26 cards when you press start. Press draw to draw cards for yourself (Player 1)
            and it will draw for the other player as well. The highest ranked card wins the round. The player that wins,
            collects both cards and they are added to their deck. If there is a tie, you will draw 4 cards from your
            pile and the 4th card will decide who wins. When you win a war, you collect all of the cards that were
            played. Once someone reaches 0 cards, the game is over. The player that still has cards left wins! Good
            Luck!
